# GoProBleRemote
Android Application to control a GoPro through bluetooth ble with Shimano D-Fly buttons or media buttons.

This is a shared personnal project with my limited programming skills.

Usage :

-A GoPro should be paired with your phone to be able to select it in the list

-A Di2 D-Fly unit should be paired with your phone to be able to select it in the list if not application will only respond to media buttons

  -If you use Di2 function, you can choose the used D-Fly chan, D-Fly buttons can be set in Shimano E-Tube application
  
 -Once settings are correctly selected you can start the service to monitor buttons press
 
 Simple press : toggle record a video (put camera into sleep on stop record)
 Double press : take a picture
 Long press : Connect/Put camera into sleep
 
 -There is also a function to sync camera date/time with gps (that help me to sync video with rides datas)
